"""Bridge the library's Bleak client factory onto Home Assistant's BLE stack.

``godox_mesh_bt`` builds its own :class:`bleak.BleakClient` and, by default,
runs a :class:`bleak.BleakScanner` to resolve an address. Neither is allowed
inside Home Assistant: the address must come from the Bluetooth manager so that
ESPHome proxies and multiple adapters keep working, and connections must go
through ``bleak-retry-connector`` for its retry and connection-slot handling.

:class:`HomeAssistantBleakClient` presents the small slice of the Bleak surface
the library actually uses, while connecting the Home Assistant way.
